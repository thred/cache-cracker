# TODO

## Code

* Tests using multiple accents
* Use accent for command parser separator (, or ;)
* Use accent for number parsing
* Rename Bool to LogicalValue
* Add Type: RegularExpression
* Use accent for Type names
* ? should be called Any instead
* Comments: Comment can happen everywhere. Consume the whole comment in the Tokenizer and add it to the next token. Do not return comments as token.
* Define Units via Definitions, Context and Scope
* Parse methods of Quantity and Unit should accept objects instead of strings.
* Implement units mathematically correct by supporting undefined units, too.
* Check all describe methods... *boooooring!*
* Fix Map and Array parsing
* Implement asMap, asArray
* Implement UnitParser like QuantityParser
* Store Types in context, too
