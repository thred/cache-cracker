# TODO

## Code

* Datatype Array should be List
* Datatype Object should be Map
* Other datatypes are String, Quantity, Unit
* Implement units mathematically correctly by supporting undefined units, too
* Chain everything, e.g. Functioncalls (fn(..) is a chain of fn and (..)), units (units may be strings, too), ...
* Interpreting an expression in a Scope variable should be an option and not automatically be performed when invoking get or required, but with a utility method afterwards
