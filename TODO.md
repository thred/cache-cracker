# TODO

## Code

* NextExpressionToken should be called nextToken (rename all expression things)
* Define Units via Definitions, Context and Scope
* Parse methods of Quantity and Unit should accept objects instead of strings.
* Invoke method of scope should take args - where should the method store values? Check all calls.
* Implement units mathematically correct by supporting undefined units, too.
* Check all describe methods... *boooooring!*
* Fix Map and Array parsing
* Implement asMap, asArray
* Implement UnitParser like QuantityParser
